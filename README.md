# Reframing Reproducibility Project 
This is a project for the Summer Undergraduate Data Science 2023 program at the University of Toronto.
*For an in depth discussion on analysis, please check <https://andrewychung.quarto.pub/suds_2023/goal_set_report.html>

### Disclaiminer: 
1. Due to security issues, the dataset was not provided in the code. The code will not run. I have instead attached screenshot figures you can view in output/fig/plots.

   ## Then what is the point of the code?
   I wanted to mimic what researchers could do if they can share both the data and code. II still think it is greatly valuable to see how I wrote my scripts using target and rendered them in quarto. Even if you may not be able to run the code yourself, you are always welcome to point out any areas of improvement and suggestions which can benefit both you and me! 
   
3. If you want to learn how to use targets and quarto, here are the resources I used to get started.

4. I apologize in advance if the folders are not organized. I had intended to have all files related to generating a report in a report folder, but ran into issues running _target.R. I was not able to fix how _target.R wants to be in the same directory with the report qmd file when rendering the report.
