# Reframing Reproducibility Project 
This is a project for the Summer Undergraduate Data Science 2023 program at the University of Toronto.
*For an in depth discussion on analysis, please check <https://andrewychung.quarto.pub/suds_2023/goal_set_report.html>

### Disclaiminer: 
1. Due to security issues, the dataset was not provided in the code. The code will not run. I have instead attached screenshot figure you can view in fig/plots.
2. If you want to learn how to use targets and quarto, here are the resources I used to get started.

   <https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio.html>

   <https://books.ropensci.org/targets/>

4. I apologize in advance if the folders are not organized. I had intended to have all files related to generating a report in a report folder, but ran into issues running _target.R. I was not able to fix how _target.R wants to be in the same directory with the report qmd file when rendering the report.
